## Brief CV

Alexander Fabisch received his diploma degree in computer science
from the University of Bremen in 2012. From 2012 to 2017 he worked
as a researcher at the robotics research group of the University of
Bremen and since 2017 he works at the Robotics Innovation Center of
the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). He
obtained his doctoral degree from University of Bremen in 2020. His
scientific interests are in the fields of machine learning,
particularly imitation learning and reinforcement learning, as well
as black-box optimization with robotic applications and a focus on
manipulation behaviors.
