Summary: My opinion on the Julia programming language.

[Julia](http://julialang.org/) is a new programming language for the
scientific community. Its main advantage over Matlab, R, etc. is its
speed. Although it is still under heavy developement I would say it
is worth taking a look at. There are already some interesting
libraries available. Some of them come from the R community
([DataFrames](https://github.com/JuliaStats/DataFrames.jl),
[GLM](https://github.com/JuliaStats/GLM.jl), ...), others are wrappers
for existing libraries ([NLOpt](https://github.com/stevengj/NLopt.jl),
[PyPlot](https://github.com/stevengj/PyPlot.jl), ...) and because of
its speed and at the same time high level of abstraction, there will
soon be coming packages that do not exist in other languages. For
those who are interested in trying it out I wrote a small
[Gist](https://gist.github.com/AlexanderFabisch/6343090) that compares
the syntax of Julia, Octave and NumPy. You can find a very motivating
introduction [here](http://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/).
